This file is a placeholder for the 192x192 pixel icon.

In a real application, you would need to create proper PNG image files for each icon size:
- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

For a production application, you should use image editing software to create these icons
from your application logo at the appropriate resolutions.
